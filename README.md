# InbreedingDepressionSeychellesWarbler
 
These are the data and scripts used to investigate individual inbreeding depression using 1,936 low coverage, whole-genome Seychelles warbler sequences that have been imputed to recover missing genotypes and verified for sample identity as in https://github.com/kiran-lee/SeychellesWarblerGenomicToolkit. 

Perhaps the most useful file to other researchers is a dataframe (frohdata.xlsx) of all birds in the Seychelles warbler database (BirdID), the plate number they were sequenced on (Plate), sequences sample name as named by Liverpool University (SeqID),  sequencing coverage (Coverage), tube number of sample used to link SeqID to BirdID  (ID), whether the ID used was BloodID or BloodTubeNumber (Identifier) FROH inbreeding coefficient estimated from PLINK (FROH_all), and inbreeding estimated by RZooRoH (FROH_2.5, FROH_5, FROH_25, _FROH_50, FROH_250, FROH_500, _FROH_2500), lifespan (Lifespan), year of birth (BirthYear), year it was last seen (LastSeenYear), lifetime offspring produced (ReproductiveOutput), natal year death rate as an environmental control of lifetime hardship faced (BirthYearDeathRate), age of mother at birth (MaternalAge).
